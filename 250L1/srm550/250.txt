Problem Statement
    
We have a string originalWord. Each character of originalWord is either 'a' or 'b'. Timmy claims that he can convert it to finalWord using exactly k moves. In each move, he can either change a single 'a' to a 'b', or change a single 'b' to an 'a'.  You are given the strings originalWord and finalWord, and the int k. Determine whether Timmy may be telling the truth. If there is a possible sequence of exactly k moves that will turn originalWord into finalWord, return "POSSIBLE" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, return "IMPOSSIBLE".

Notes
-
Timmy may change the same letter multiple times. Each time counts as a different move.
Constraints
-
originalWord will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.

Examples
0)

    
"aababba"
"bbbbbbb"
2
Returns: "IMPOSSIBLE"
It is not possible to reach finalWord in fewer than 4 moves.
1)

    
"aabb"
"aabb"
1
Returns: "IMPOSSIBLE"
The number of moves must be exactly k=1.
2)

    
"aaaaabaa"
"bbbbbabb"
8
Returns: "POSSIBLE"
Use each move to change each of the letters once.
3)

    
"aaa"
"bab"
4
Returns: "POSSIBLE"
The following sequence of 4 moves does the job: aaa -> baa -> bab -> aab -> bab
4)

    
"aababbabaa"
"abbbbaabab"
9
Returns: "IMPOSSIBLE"
