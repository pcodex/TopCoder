Problem Statement
    
A string of zeros and ones is called an alternating string if no two adjacent characters are the same. Examples of alternating strings: "1", "10101", "0101010101".  You are given a string s. Each character of s is a '0' or a '1'. Please find the longest contiguous substring of s that is an alternating string. Return the length of that substring.

Examples
0)

    
"111101111"
Returns: 3
Among all substrings, there are 5 different alternating strings: "1", "0", "10", "01", "101". The one with maximal length is "101" and the length is 3.
1)

    
"1010101"
Returns: 7
The string s itself is an alternating string.
2)

    
"000011110000"
Returns: 2
Note that a substring must be contiguous. The longest alternating substrings of this s are "01" and "10". The string "010" is not a substring of this s.
3)

    
"1011011110101010010101"
Returns: 8

4)

    
"0"
Returns: 1
